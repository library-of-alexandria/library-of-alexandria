## Hypotheses and explanations (The scientific method)

What makes something true?

* Generate hypotheses, test them.
* Disentangle atomic factors.
* ?

learning to abduct (can be broken up further. ILP then using that to abduct?)

Candidate problems; 
* Chess (b.c. ...).
* Atari. (Do the atari games have their rules in some nice standard format? what constitutes a rule?)
* some kind of explanation task?

## Integrating new and existing knowledge

Need a data structure!?
Also need to add compression here?

Candidate problem(s); 

* Knowledge base construction from ?
* WikiarXiv. Parse arxiv/similar to construct a relational database of research (similar to wikipathways/wikigenome/...). 
  * Various proofs and their implications and relationship to assumptions.  
  * Datasets and their relationship to models (ie accuracy) and to deeper problems.
  * ?
* ?

## Science in the real world

* Designing experiments. But specific to the real world. Need to be safe, need to trade off feasibility, need to manage many in parallel, need to maximise use of resources, 
* What is important? This is where we need to guide it? We want to not just understand the world, but preferably find 'impactful' knowledge first?
* Automated collection of data. But cannot just collect everything...
* Denoising, adding labels/correlating with other sources, ...

***

Alternative paths;

* jorunalism. Solution to fake news. Predict truithiness of articles, explain reasoning, cite sources of evience. Financial incentive to be more accurate.
* law.
