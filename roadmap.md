What is science? What do scientists do? What tasks are we automating?

## Hypotheses and explanations

Generate hypotheses, test them against

learning to abduct (can be broken up further. ILP then using that to abduct?)

Candidate problem: Chess.
Atari. (Do the atari games have their rules in some nice standard format? what constitutes a rule?)

## Integrating new and existing knowledge

Need a data structure!?

Integrate wikipedia, ? and academic papers (from arxiv/biorxiv)

Candidate problem: Knowledge base construction and ?

## Designing experiments in the real world

This is the evidence gathering part of science. But specific to the real world. Need to be safe, need to trade off feasibility, need to manage many in parallel, need to maximise use of resources,

This is where we need to guide it? We want to not just understand the world, but preferably find 'impactful' knowledge first?

<!-- What about;
- collecting data?

Possible paths to ???;

* jorunalism. Solution to fake news. Predict truithiness of articles, explain reasoning, cite sources of evience. Financial incentive to be more accurate.
* law. 
* science.
