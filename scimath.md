## Automated science and math

Math and science have become too big for individuals. We find it hard to keep up and to cram the relevant knowledge into our small heads. We need better tools to continue push the boundaries.


What do we want to be able to do? What are the outputs of science and math and how can we automate them?

## Whats is science?

There is a distinction between the scientific method (aka doing science) and what scientists actually do with their time (magaging, proposing, ...). 
Also, the scientific method, as commonly though of is incomplete. 
Observe, hypothesise, falisfy, repeat...

Three parts?

* The processes that disentangle truth from data. (must be accurate)
* The integration and representation of knowledge. (must be accessible)
* The querying of the real world. (must be ?)
* (others? - exploration of the unknown?)

Reducing knowledge to distinct packets of knowledge.

This only considers what you should do once you have found an interesting question you want answered. First definitions need to be made, (is this really true?) 

* What makes something true? Evidence and only a single theory that fits the evidence.
* Math is weird. Since it all follows logical ... ? What we are looking for is things that are; beautiful, interpretable, have an intuitive explanation, clearly apply in the real world, examples, ...?
* What makes good scientific research? Removing uncertainty, increasing possibilities (new questions), ???, ...


## What do scientist and mathematicians do?


* Write papers,
* Write grant proposals,
* Review and accept papers into journals, 
* Supervise students,
* Teach courses,
* Explain their insights to popular audiences,
* Apply knowledge to societal and industrial problems,
* Design experiments (out of curiosity or to falsify a theory),
* Make conjectures,
* Find links between existing work,
* Differentiate between classes,
* Define new problems,
* Gather data,
* 

## What do science and math actually achieve?

* Compress knowledge
* Make precise and clear, rigorous, remove uncertainty (is this the same as compression?)
* Narrow the search via experiments (but also expand it with new questions?)
* Certainty (via evidence)
* Understanding in others
* Application in the real world. Make lives better.

## What are the problems?

* Assigning credit/resources.
* Incentives for reproduction.
* Benchmarks
* Standardised ?
* ?

### Graph representations of papers/science

* Construct various graphs; (not would prefer the graph nodes to be topics/ideas/theories rather than papers)
  * Citation network
  * Similarity network
  * Dependency network (based on the math? or just ordering in time?)
* Construct a graph from a single paper!!?


### The data

* Get papers from arxiv (or similar? biovix, sci-hub, ...).
* Create new DS for parsed papers? And then manually label a bunch of papers myself?
* Math databases? Parse papers and construct a database? (e.g. for computational complexity?)


### Benchmarks


### Collecting evidence

* Parse papers and pick out the evidence. 
* A search engine for evidence. 
  * Query(smoking, cancer) -> fn(p(cancer) = m\*smoking + c)
  * Query(gravity) -> ???

Case studies on different parts of science.

## Understanding the brain

* Lots of different data types that need to be integrated (measurement only capture a small part of the truth).
* Many different models that are partially true. Need to rank them?
* Many models of different parts of the brain, need to be integrated into a whole brain model.

Aka automated datascience?

## De-novo drug design

?

### Useful projects (in the short term)

* Automatic meta-analysis: cluster papers on the same topic, extract results, weight by reliability, integrate.
* Clustering: find similar ideas across different fields
* UCB algorithm for allocating grant money (explore-exploit). Matching researchers and grants?
* Tree search through proofs
* Automated journals,

***

* Summarisation, distillation and explanation.
* Truth propagation. A graph of theories, that is pruned with evidence, ...
* Active learning (predict experiments)
* Automated education.
