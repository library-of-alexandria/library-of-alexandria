What do we want to be able to do? What are the outputs of science and math and how can we automate them?

Let start with, what do scientist and mathematicians do?

* Write papers
* Write grant proposals
* Review and accept papers into journals 
* Supervise students
* Teach courses
* Explain their insights to popular audiences
* Apply knowledge to societal and industrial problems
* Design experiments (out of curiosity or to falsify a theory)
* Make conjectures
* Find links between existing work
* Differentiate between classes
* Define new problems

But what do they actually achieve?

* Compress knowledge
* Make precise and clear, rigorous, remove uncertainty (is this the same as compression?)
* Narrow the search via experiments (but also expand it with new questions?)
* Understanding in others
* Application in the real world. Make lives better.

How can we measure these achievements? How can we design benchmarks? What do we need to do this?
